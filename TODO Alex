Now (by order of priority) :

Clean quotes
$

handle $PATH or other $
	-> put variable value if $ in cmd line (actually easy, replace by the actual var)
	-> if not included in " " ?
handle quotes
	-> test with TESTMODE_FILE lines

code a function that will test if a string (that will be contained in cmd.command) is accessible in one of the paths (mini.paths)
	-> Josephine ?
	-> I will use the result in cmd.type (0 for yes, -1 for no)

Idea : epur quotes


FIND GOOD ERROR HANDLING SYSTEM


fill_cmd_args
coder cas double pipe "||"
Signals




After :

reesayer de mettre total cmd   //maybe plus tard
fill_cmd_type ()


Idea for error handling :

1 - make enum amout errors (ex : MALLOC_EROR)
2 - store them in cmd.error (and return at the same time)
3 - check error in main, after parsing
