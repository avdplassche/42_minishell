Now (by order of priority) :

handle $PATH or other $
	-> handle case where single quoted var is double enquoted
	-> if not included in " " ?
	-> handle case where index == -1


code a function that will test if a string (that will be contained in cmd.command) is accessible in one of the paths (mini.paths)
	-> Josephine ?
	-> I will use the result in cmd.type (0 for yes, -1 for no)


FIND GOOD ERROR HANDLING SYSTEM


After :

fill_cmd_args
coder cas double pipe "||"
Signals




Idea for error handling :

1 - make enum amout errors (ex : MALLOC_EROR)
2 - store them in cmd.error (and return at the same time)
3 - check error in main, after parsing
